""" Timelink projects

A project is a collection of Kleio sources and a database to store the data.

Access of the user to Kleio sources is done through a Kleio server.
In the Kleio server each user has an acess token that determines the
access level to the sources directory. So for each project the user
needs to have a valid access token to the Kleio server and its url.

Each project is associated with a database. Timelink is tested with
PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.

When using SQLite, the database is a file in the file system.
When using PostgreSQL, each project is associated with a database
(see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/managing-databases.html)
and each project is associated with a user and a password to access the database.

users have different access levels to the projects. The access levels are:
1. admin: the user has full access to the project, including the ability to associate
    new users to the project.
2. manager: the user has access to the project, can import data and identify
    entities in the data, can add commentaries, but cannot associate new users
    to the project.
3. colaborator: the user has access to the project, cannot import data, but can
    identify entities in the data and add commentaries.
4. viewer: the user has access to the project, but cannot import data, identify
    people or add commentaries.
