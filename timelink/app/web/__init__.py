"""
FastAPI routers for the web interface of Timelink.

This is the main switch board of the FastUI web interface.

All the top level routers are defined here, and also
the subrouters, like the /auth router, that handles
the login and logout pages.

To add future pages:

1. Write a new function in a separate file that produces the
   components for the new tab: see :mod:`webapp_info` for
   inspiration.
2. Here import the page and add a new router that calls
   the new function to collect the components and call
   :func:`home_page` to wrap the components in a page.
3. If the new page handles subpaths, like /auth/login,
   it is better to create a new router in the new page
   and include it here, like the /auth router is included.
